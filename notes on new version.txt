scum dev board:
smaller, but usably sized like arduino

3 versions
1.5v battery version
3.3v battery version
IMU on the third option or optional on other two


accelerometer
UART, but better connection. maybe not part of same board because the microUSB port is not robust. Separate board. Adaptor.
RF 232 level shifter?
current dev board design should be on atlassian


metric:
standards compliant, crystal free. bluetooth. works with phone, works with other motes. peer to peer. other motes require a high power base station. glorified RF tags. needs a base station that's really big.

The current one has some foot prints on int for an IMU, temperature sensor, a coin cell batter holder and a wireless battery charger. (user guide section 5)
Apparently has two 74AVC4TD245PW trasceivers?
