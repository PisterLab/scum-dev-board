Currently there are three versions of the dev board in this folder
- scum3c_devboard is a KiCad model of the currently in-use board as of October 12th 2020. It might be not 100% accurate to the original: https://github.com/PisterLab/scum-dev-board/blob/master/SCM3C_PCB.pdf
- scum3c_devboard_deleted_elements is a small 30 mm x30 mm board. It was made by deleting unnecessary things from the currently in-use board. It has headers for GPIO, 3WB, UART, VBAT, and VDDIO. An LED is supposed to light up when the board programs.
- scum3c_devboard_large is a larger board, supposed to replace the currenly in-use board
